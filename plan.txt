a text based game of Tic Tac Toe
initial plan

1. create a grid first
2. insert inputs in blank spaces
    a. create the mutable blank spaces
    b. create mechanism for specifying blank spaces
        1. perhaps create an array that has the 9 spaces on a grid and then also display a dummy grid specifying
           which position corresponds with the number in menu displayed to them.
3. create loop that reprints grid with inputs
4. create if statements that check to see if win conditions are met and break loop and declare winner if so
